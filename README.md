# Code for snRNA-seq analysis
This repository contains the R and python scripts used to analyse the single-nucleus RNA sequencing data in the PhD thesis "Differential impact of maternal immune activation on cell types in the developing neocortex" by Laura Wolbeck. \
R was used mainly, while python was only used for RNA velocity analysis with scVelo. \
"Notebooks 1 - 3" contain the code for R, "Annotation" is a file explaining the cell type annotation process + code, and "scVelo" conains the RNA velocity analysis performed in python. "scRNA_helper_new" contains functions used in the R scripts.
Notebook 2 contains cell cycle and cellchat analysis.

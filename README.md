# Code for snRNA-seq analysis
This repositry contains the R and python scripts used to analyse the single-nuclei RNA sequencing data in the PhD thesis "Differential impact of maternal immune activation on cell types in the developing neocortex" by Laura Wolbeck. 
R was used mainly, while python was only used for RNA velocity analysis with scVelo. Notebooks 1 - 3 contain the code for R, "Annotation" i a file explaining the cell type annotation process and code and scVelo conains hte RNA velocity analysis performed in python. "scRNA_analysis_helper_function_new" contains functions used in the R scripts.

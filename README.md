# Code for snRNA-seq analysis
This repositry contains the R and python scripts used to analyse the single-nuclei RNA sequencing data in the PhD thesis "Differential impact of maternal immune activation on cell types in the developing neocortex" by Laura Wolbeck. 
R was used mainly, while python was only used for RNA velocity analysis with scVelo.
